Developer Tools helps the WordPress developer to log any variable or function of which they need the output, without bloating their current page or live environment.


== Description ==

Developer Tools currently only supports logging of variables and functions. Features such as profiling a website's
database querying and server memory usage are not yet supported.

= Features =

 - Log any type of variable
 - Watch for new log entries through the backend interface
 - That's it for now :)


== Installation ==

1. Install Developer Tools either via the WordPress.org plugin directory, or by uploading the files to your server.

2. After activating Developer Tools, go to the "Developer Tools" sub-menu item in the dashboard's "Tools" menu.

3. Add a call to the log method in your code.

4. Sit back and enjoy the log entries that start coming in.
