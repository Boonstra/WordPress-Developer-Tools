Developer Tools helps developers to log any variable, error or exception of which they need the value, without bloating
their live environment.


== Description ==

Developer Tools currently only supports logging of variables, errors and exceptions. Features such as profiling a
website's database queries and server memory usage are not yet supported.

= Features =

 - Log any type of variable
 - Log any catchable error or exception
 - Watch for new log entries through the backend interface
 - No bloating the live environment with developer dumps
 - That's it for now :)


== Installation ==

1. Install Developer Tools either via the WordPress.org plugin directory, or by uploading the files to your server.

2. After activating Developer Tools, go to the "Developer Tools" sub-menu item in the dashboard's "Tools" menu.

3. Add a call to the log method in your code, or make some programming mistakes.

4. Sit back and enjoy the log entries that start coming in.
